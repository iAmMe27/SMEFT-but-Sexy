What is SMEFT but Sexy you ask? Well, I'll tell you!

It's a modlist that is, for all intent and purpose, the same as SMEFT but with a few additions to make a basic framework for NSFW modding or a NSFW modlist for very low end hardware. Like SMEFT, the modlist doesn't feature anything that changes Skyrim much (aside from NPCs) so hardware requirements are the same as the recommended Skyrim Special Edition ones.

SMEFT but Sexy uses the 1.5.97 exe for a currently greater compatibility with mods available out there.

## Installing SMEFT but Sexy

SMEFT but Sexy is available on the Wabbajack UI - make sure you have "Show Unofficial Lists" checked in the top right. 

Start with the original SMEFT readme as written by Luca here: https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/SME-FT-/

Everything in that readme is extremely important for you to read and you *will* need to follow it to the letter.

## So, what's different?

SMEFT but Sexy is built on SMEFT and updates to SMEFT but Sexy will follow the base SMEFT list closely. Included is the OSuite of mods for the NSFW orientated stuff, body replacers for male and females as well as a basic NPC visuals overhaul for all (please let me know if I missed any!) NPCs in Skyrim. That's it! The rest is up to you and you don't even have to stick with what I've done so far!

If you want to change NPCs out, make sure to check over the NPC CR patch included out of the box - this patch merges the visual changes with the functional changes from USSEP so you may need to remove NPCs from that patch if you want to change NPC visual replacer mods.
